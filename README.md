# Brazilian-E-commerce-public-dataset
This project analyzes e-commerce data from the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset on Kaggle. 

Ongoing analysis of e-commerce data, currently focusing on delivery day patterns and seller performance. Planning to expand insights further.

Data Preparation: Merged relevant tables to create a unified dataset.
Delivery Days Analysis: Focused on delivered orders to understand shipping times and delays.
Seller Performance: Evaluated sellers' performance based on key metrics.
Seller Segmentation: Grouped sellers into segments based on total revenue.


This analysis is ongoing, and I plan to expand it with deeper insights in the future.
